Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm which is both a statistical and a machine learning algorithm. It is used to predict the real-valued output y based on the given input value x. 
It depicts the relationship between the dependent variable y and the independent variables xi  ( or features ).  
The hypothetical function used for prediction is represented by h( x )




Linear regression aims to establish a linear relationship between the input variables (features) and the output variable (target). 
The goal is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual values. Mathematically, this line can be represented as:

y = wx + b ………………..(eq 1)

Simple Linear Regression:
Simple Linear Regression specifically refers to the case where there is only one independent variable (x) predicting a single dependent variable (y). 
The relationship between x and y is modeled as a straight line, represented by the equation:

y=mx+b……………………eq(2)
